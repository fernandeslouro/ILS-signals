# ILS-signals

This repository includes code capable of emulation and graphical presentation of ILS (Instrument Landing System) signals. 

It was developed by João Louro, Marina Moreira and Paulo Macedo as a final project for the subject of Integrated Avionics Systems, part of the curriculum of Integrated Masters in Aerospace Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.

The graphical presentation of the ILS signal imitates the dials present in real aircraft, and is processed by the Cairo Graphics library.

The program is well documented (in Portuguese) in the "Relatório.pdf" file.
